Adapted from Serious Eats <https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/04/grilling-chicken-fajitas-cinco-de-mayo-mexican-recipe.html>

##Ingredients
For the marinade:
* Bunch of chopped fresh cilantro
* Juice of three limes
* 1-2 cloves minced garlic
* Good splash of olive oil
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/2-in thick

For the vegetables:
* 1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips
* 1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips
* 1 large white onion, cut into 1/4-inch strips
* Olive oil
* Cheese
* Kosher salt
* Sour cream (optional)
* Salsa
* Flour tortillas

##Recipe
1. In a small bowl, mix together all of the ingredients for the marinade. Place the chicken breasts in a large Ziplock bag and pour marinade all over. Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible and allow to marinate for 30 minutes in the refrigerator, or while prepping the other ingredients.

2. Heat a cast iron pan and cook over high heat until browned on both sides and cooked through, about three to five minutes per side. Remove the from the grill and allow to rest five to ten minutes. Slice into 1/2 inch strips.

3. While the chicken is resting, toss the peppers and onion with a little olive oil and a pinch of salt. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until they are soft and nicely browned, about 5 to 10 minutes.

4. Assemble fajitas with the vegetables, chicken and cheese, then grill on a panini grill until warm.
